/**
 * Stack navigation — writable store (Svelte 4 store API, works in Svelte 5).
 *
 * Usage:
 *   stack.push(Component, props, onReturn?)  → opens a page on top
 *   stack.pop(returnData?)                   → goes back, calls onReturn with data
 *                                              and gives the focus back (see below)
 *   stack.clear()                            → reset (call in onMount cleanup)
 *   stack.subscribe(...)                     → standard store reactivity
 *
 * Browser Back is handled by the host page with popstate + history.pushState
 * (see +page.svelte in playground/stack for the pattern).
