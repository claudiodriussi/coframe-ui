   * CollectionView.svelte — a collection edited inside its parent's form.
   *
   * The grid shows the buffer and the navigator's three gestures write to it.
   * Nothing here talks to the database: the frame that owns the aggregate writes
   * the whole tree in one transaction (relations.md §17).
   *
   * A row opens on a frame of its own, which edits a **copy** and hands it back
   * on confirm. The live reference would spare the copy and make cancelling
   * impossible, because it would mean undoing mutations that already happened.
   *
   * Props:
   *   node    CollectionNode   the layout node: model, fk, row form, view
   *   agg     Aggregate        the tree — its counter hands out temporary ids
   *   parent  TreeNode         the node this collection hangs from
