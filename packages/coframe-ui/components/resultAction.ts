/**
 * What to do with what an operation answered.
 *
 * An operation that runs from a menu item, from a row action or from a
 * navigator command ends the same way: it has done something, and the person
 * who asked deserves to see what. That last step is not always a dialog —
 * sometimes the answer IS a page (the rows that failed, a preview to work
 * through), sometimes a menu of what can be done next — so the server says
 * which, using the same `action` vocabulary as everything else: a scalar verb
 * plus its sibling keys.
 *
 *   {status: 'success', data: {message, detail, touched?}}       → a box; the
 *       view then refreshes the touched keys, or everything when none are named
 *   {status: 'success', data: {action: 'stack_push', panel: …}}  → a page
 *   {action: 'choose', options: [{label, current?, then}]}       → a menu; the
 *       pick's `then` is applied with these same rules
 *   {action: 'endpoint', op, params, confirm?}                   → another call,
 *       whose answer is applied with these same rules
 *   {action: 'set_query_params', params}                         → keys the view
 *       carries on every query from now on
 *
 * Saying nothing means a box, which is what most operations want and keeps the
 * common case free of ceremony. The client never interprets the words: only the
 * server knows how many rows it touched, and only the server knows what
 * `include_archived` means. A `choose` whose options carry a ready-made
 * `endpoint` call is how a server-driven popup works without the client
 * knowing what any entry does.
